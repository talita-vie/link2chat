> **"Time is money. Stop saving temporary contacts just to say 'Hello'."**

### 💼 The Business Problem
Sales teams and recruiters spend hours manually saving phone numbers into their contacts just to send a first message on WhatsApp. This friction slows down outreach and reduces daily conversion rates.

### 💡 The Solution
**Link2Chat** is a custom Chrome Extension built to eliminate this bottleneck. It allows professionals to start a WhatsApp conversation with any number instantly, directly from their browser, without clogging their phone book.
